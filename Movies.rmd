1. **Read the Data File (Movies.csv)
If you have the Movies.csv file uploaded or placed in a directory, you can use the read.csv function to load it into R.
# Read the Movies.csv file into a data frame

install.packages("readr")
library(readr)
movies_data <- read.csv("path/to/Movies.csv")

2. Summarize the Data
You can use the dplyr package to group by Director_1 and calculate the count of movies and the sum of revenue.

First, make sure you have the dplyr package installed:
# Install dplyr if you haven't already
install.packages("dplyr")

Then, use the following code to group the data and calculate the required summary:
# Load the dplyr package
library(dplyr)
# Summarize the data: count movies and sum revenue by Director_1
summary_data <- movies_data %>%
  group_by(Director_1) %>%
  summarise(
    Movies_count = n(), # Count the number of movies per director
Total_Revenue = sum(Revenue, na.rm = TRUE)  # Sum of Revenue, ignoring NA values
  ) %>%
  arrange(desc(Total_Revenue))  # Order by Total_Revenue in descending order
  
3. Save the Result as a New Table (Optional)
If you'd like to save the result to a new CSV file:
# Save the summarized result to a new CSV file
write.csv(summary_data, "Director1_summary.csv", row.names = FALSE)
This will save the summarized data with directors, movie counts, and total revenue as a new CSV file called Director1_summary.csv.

# View the resultummary_data <- movies_data %>%
  summary_data <- movies_data %>%
+     group_by(Director._1_) %>%
+     summarise(
+         Movies_count = n(), 
+         Total_Revenue = sum(Revenue, na.rm = TRUE)
+     ) %>%
+     arrange(desc(Total_Revenue))
print(summary_data)



# View the result
> print(summary_data)

That means your grouping, summarizing, and sorting are now all working correctly in RStudio.

You now have a nice summary table showing:

Director name (Director _1_)

Number of movies (Movies_count)

Total revenue (Total_Revenue), ordered from highest to lowest.


This is an [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) Notebook. When you execute code within the notebook, the results appear beneath the code. 

Try executing this chunk by clicking the *Run* button within the chunk or by placing your cursor inside it and pressing *Ctrl+Shift+Enter*. 

```{r}
plot(cars)
```

Add a new chunk by clicking the *Insert Chunk* button on the toolbar or by pressing *Ctrl+Alt+I*.

When you save the notebook, an HTML file containing the code and output will be saved alongside it (click the *Preview* button or press *Ctrl+Shift+K* to preview the HTML file).

The preview shows you a rendered HTML copy of the contents of the editor. Consequently, unlike *Knit*, *Preview* does not run any R code chunks. Instead, the output of the chunk when it was last run in the editor is displayed.
